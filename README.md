🛠️ E-commerce SQL Analysis (Work in Progress)
📌 Project Overview

This is my first analytics project using SQL.
The goal is to analyze an E-commerce dataset and answer key business questions such as:

Which products generate the most revenue?

Which countries have the highest number of customers?

What is the conversion rate from cart → checkout → payment?

Currently, I am still working on the analysis and queries. This repository will be updated step by step.
